His troubles begin when he descends from this unspoiled setting and drives into a small beach town named Big Rock (Morro Bay). A minor traffic accident in which a motorist hits a motorcyclist results in a savage beating by members of the Born Losers Motorcycle Club. The horrified bystanders (including Laughlin's wife, Delores Taylor, and their two children in cameo roles) are too afraid to help or be involved in any way. Billy Jack jumps into the fray and rescues the man by himself. At this point the police arrive and arrest Billy for using a rifle to stop the fight. (The irony here is that, unknown to Billy, the motorist is the one who starts the fight by inexplicably insulting one of the bikers.)\r\n",
      "The police throw Billy in jail and the judge fines him heavily for discharging a rifle in public. He is treated with suspicion and hostility by the police. Meanwhile, the marauding bikers terrorize the town, rape four teenage girls (Jane Russell plays the mother of one of the girls), and threaten anyone slated to testify against them. One of the girls, played by Susan Foster, later recants, saying she willingly gave herself to the biker gang. (Foster would go on to play a larger supporting role in Billy Jack.)\r\n",

Police arrive at the crime scene, where SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) finds a blackmail note signed \"Scorpio\" ordering the city to pay $100,000 or the culprit will continue to kill. The mayor (John Vernon) asks police officers what is being done to track the killer.\r\n",

      "Callahan is assigned a new partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni), whom he believes to be an inexperienced rookie. Scorpio is staking out potential victims near a public park, but is spotted by a police helicopter and runs away. Callahan and his new partner believe they see him that night on the streets, but in the course of tracing him to his home, Callahan looks into a window and briefly watches a sexual encounter before being caught by neighbors who try to beat him up as a peeping Tom, until Chico interferes.\r\n",
      "Based on Scorpio's communications, the city decides he will next try to kill a Catholic priest. They set up a stake-out, and set Callahan and Gonzalez on another rooftop from which they can see the building from which they believe Scorpio will strike. Callahan gets again distracted watching a sexual encounter. Scorpio arrives and there is a shootout, in which a policeman disguised as a priest is killed.\r\n",
      "Scorpio delivers a second ransom demand to the police, stating he has now kidnapped a teenage girl who he says will die if his demands are not met. Callahan is assigned to deliver a case full of money. He waits near a pier as directed by Scorpio who calls Callahan on a nearby pay phone, giving him instructions to go to another location in the city with another payphone, where he will call again. During his trip through the city, Callahan is confronted by would-be robbers and a young man seeking gay sex. Finally, Callahan encounters Scorpio at the Mount Davidson cross. Scorpio then beats Callahan into submission before telling him that he intends to let the girl die. Gonzalez has been following them and there is a shootout between his partner and Scorpio, in which the former is wounded. After being stabbed in the leg with a knife by Callahan, Scorpio escapes without the money and reports to a hospital.\r\n",
      "The police learn of Scorpio's hospital visit, and a doctor recalls having met Scorpio previously and remembers he lives in a room at Kezar Stadium where he also works. Callahan finds Scorpio there. In a chase across the stadium field, Callahan first shoots Scorpio, and then tortures him by standing on his wounded leg demanding to know where the girl is being held. Scorpio confesses, but by then, it is too late as the girl is ultimately found dead.\r\n",
      "The district attorney (Josef Sommer) tells Callahan that Scorpio's rights have been violated, and they cannot hold him, but must let him go. Callahan is outraged, but continues to shadow Scorpio on his own time. Scorpio pays a man $200 to beat him severely, then reports to a hospital claiming he is a victim of police brutality. Harry's new partner decides to quit the police force.\r\n",
      "Scorpio robs a liquor store and acquires a handgun. He then hijacks a school bus and contacts the police with yet another ransom demand for money and a flight out of the Santa Rosa airport. Callahan manages to jump onto the roof of the hijacked bus from an overpass. After Callahan forces Scorpio off the bus, the latter flees to a nearby quarry and holds a boy at gunpoint. Having shot Scorpio through the shoulder, Callahan reprises his line about losing count of his shots. Unlike the earlier encounter, Callahan does have one remaining bullet, with which he kills Scorpio when the latter goes for his gun. Callahan takes out his inspector's badge and throws it into the water before walking away. \n",

      "The next day, Devlin and his men drive to the prairie and find Mary Ann in a barn, where he is entertaining guests at a white slave (prostitute) auction. Devlin demands the money from Mary Ann, who tells him to come to the county fair the next day to get it. Mary Ann tells him Chicago is \"an old sow, begging for cream\" that should be melted down.\r\n",
      "As they are standing by a cattle pen with naked young women offered for auction, one of them, Poppy, begs Devlin for help. Devlin takes her with him \"on account.\" Back at the hotel, she tells Devlin her history of growing up at an orphanage in Missouri with her close friend, Violet, before they were brought to the slave auction.\r\n",

When they try to leave the field, they are chased by a combine harvester operator. Poppy falls and they are nearly sliced up by the machine's blades.\r\n",
      "Devlin and Poppy are saved by the arrival of Devlin's men in their car, which they abandon and let ram into the front of the combine. Devlin's driver shoots the combine operator. The entire car is demolished by the threshing apparatus and turned into bales of hay and metal.\r\n",
      "They hitch a ride back into Kansas City on a truck. Devlin jumps off near the river and sends the rest of them with Poppy back into town. He enters a houseboat, the luxurious accommodation of Clarabelle, purchased for her by Mary Ann; she is there alone. He gets information on the whereabouts of Mary Ann. Clarabelle attempts to seduce him, but he rebuffs her. Clarabelle tells him she would be perfectly happy being a widow and joining Devlin again.

      "Devlin stops the car on the edge of a field of sunflowers near Mary Ann's farm. They approach the farm through the field and engage in a long gun battle with Mary Ann's men, a seemingness infinite number of identical men wearing bib overalls. Both of Devlin's men are hit. He tells them to stay behind while he advances with the submachine gun. Unable to get past Mary Ann's men, he stops a truck hauling livestock, commandeers it and uses it to ram the gate and smash into the greenhouse on the farm, demolishing it.\r\n",
      "Devlin kills several of Mary Ann's men, then advances into the barn where Mary Ann and his brother are holding Poppy. From behind an apparently bulletproof bale of hay, he hits Mary Ann, who falls seriously injured down into a pig pen. Enraged at seeing his brother shot, Weenie runs toward Devlin, who kills him. As he dies, Weenie tries to stab Devlin with a sausage.\r\n",
      "Devlin carries Poppy out of the barn. They pass the mortally wounded Mary Ann, flat on his back, next to a sow pen. Mary Ann taunts Devlin to kill him, telling him to finish him off, like he would an animal. Devlin tells him that since Mary Ann is a man, not an animal, he won't do that. He walks away, leaving Mary Ann to die on his back.\r\n",

The lack of evidence of a break-in, Helen's lucrative life insurance policy, and a misunderstood 9-1-1 call result in Kimble's conviction of first-degree murder. Being transported to death row by bus, his fellow prisoners attempt an escape. The pandemonium sends the bus down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble escapes the collision and flees. Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard and his colleagues Renfro, Biggs, Newman and Poole arrive at the crash site and begin the search for Kimble. Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his wounds and alter his appearance. He eludes the authorities, but Gerard corners him at the edge of a storm drain over a dam. Kimble leaps into the raging water and escapes.\r\n",

Posing as a janitor, Kimble enters the local county hospital's prosthetic department to obtain a list of people who had their prosthetic arm repaired shortly after his wife's murder. Following a police lead confirming Kimble's recent whereabouts, Gerard speculates that Kimble is searching for the one-armed man. Kimble breaks into the residence of one of the people on the list, a former police officer named Fredrick Sykes. Kimble discovers that Sykes is the murderer and is employed by a pharmaceutical company, Devlin MacGregor, which is scheduled to release a new drug called Provasic. Kimble investigated the drug in the past and revealed that it caused liver damage, which would have prevented it from being approved by the FDA. He also deduces that Nichols, who is leading the drug's development, arranged a cover-up and ordered Sykes to kill him â€“ his wife's death was incidental. Gerard follows Kimble's lead to Sykes' home and draws the same conclusion.\r\n",
      "As Kimble takes an elevated train to confront Nichols at the drug's presentation in a hotel, Sykes appears and attacks him. In the struggle, Sykes shoots a transit cop before being subdued and handcuffed to a pole by Kimble.

President Bennett learns that the man was murdered because of his ties to a drug cartel, having skimmed over $650 million from it. The President tells James Cutter, his National Security Advisor, that Colombian drug cartels represent a \"clear and present danger\" to the U.S., indirectly giving him unofficial permission to kill the men responsible for his friend's murder. When Vice Admiral Jim Greer is stricken with terminal cancer, Jack Ryan is appointed Deputy Director for Intelligence and is asked to go before Congress to request increased funding for ongoing CIA operations in Colombia.\r\n",

      "Neil McCauley, a career criminal, hires Waingro to help him rob $1.6Â million in bearer bonds from an armored car. During the heist, Waingro impulsively kills a guard, infuriating McCauley. When his crew, Chris Shiherlis, Michael Cheritto and Trejo, attempt to kill Waingro, he escapes.\r\n",
      "McCauley's fence, Nate, suggests he sell the stolen bonds back to their original owner, money launderer Roger Van Zant. Van Zant agrees, but instructs his men to ambush McCauley at the meeting. McCauley survives the ambush and vows revenge against Van Zant.\r\n",
      "LAPD Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, working with Sergeant Drucker and Detectives Sammy Casals, Mike Bosko, and Danny Schwartz, investigate the heist and identify McCauley's crew as the perpetrators. They discover their next target to be a precious metals depository. The unit stakes out the depository and observe the crime in progress, but inadvertently alert McCauley to their presence. McCauley abandons the burglary. Hanna, dissatisfied with the lack of evidence, lets McCauley's crew escape.\r\n",
      "Despite the increased police surveillance, McCauley's crew agrees to one last brazen bank robbery worth $12Â million to secure their financial futures. Waingro approaches Van Zant with information about eliminating McCauley's crew. McCauley starts a relationship with Eady, a designer he meets in a cafe. Hanna moves into a hotel after learning his wife Justine is having an affair.\r\n",
      "Hanna pulls over McCauley on the freeway and invites him to coffee. Face-to-face, the aging professionals bond over their personal problems. Hanna's concern for his depressed stepdaughter Lauren and his string of failed marriages due to work, and McCauley's solitary life of a career criminal which, forbidding attachment and requiring mobility, makes his romantic relationships tenuous. Both men reaffirm their commitment to their work and to using lethal force if necessary to stop the other.\r\n",
      "After coffee, Hanna discovers that McCauley's crew have evaded their surveillance. When Trejo withdraws from the robbery at the last minute, McCauley recruits ex-convict Donald Breedan into the crew. Hanna's unit receives a confidential tip and interrupt McCauley's crew in the middle of their bank robbery. In the ensuing gunfight, several police officers, including Bosko, are killed, while McCauley's crew loses Breedan and Cheritto. Shiherlis is wounded, but escapes with McCauley.\r\n",
      "McCauley leaves Shiherlis with a doctor to treat his wounds. He breaks into Trejo's house to find Trejo near death. Trejo reveals that Waingro alerted Van Zant to their bank robbery, who subsequently informed the police. McCauley finishes off Trejo at his own request, then kills Van Zant at his home. McCauley approaches Eady, who has accepted his criminal activities, with a plan to flee to New Zealand.\r\n",
      "Hanna orders police surveillance on Waingro and leaks his location to criminal channels, suspecting McCauley will attempt to kill him before leaving town. Shiherlis' estranged wife Charlene is detained in a police safehouse, where Drucker threatens her with criminal charges if she doesn't betray Shiherlis to police. Charlene agrees, but when Shiherlis shows up in disguise, she surreptitiously warns him, allowing Shiherlis to slip through the dragnet.\r\n",

McCauley and Eady drive to the airport when he receives word of Waingro's location at a nearby hotel. Initially dismissive, McCauley decides to risk his freedom for revenge. He infiltrates the hotel, pulling a fire alarm to distract security and confronts Waingro before killing him. Moments away from escape, he notices Hanna approaching through the crowds and is forced to abandon Eady for his freedom.\r\n",
      "Hanna chases McCauley into a field outside the LAX freight terminal. In the cat-and-mouse shootout, McCauley is exposed, and Hanna mortally wounds him. Near death, McCauley offers his hand to Hanna, who takes it, and respectfully watches his adversary die. \n",

Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save Rome from corruption. Commodus murders his father when he is told about the plan.\r\n",
      "Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty, but the general refuses. Maximus is arrested by guards and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and rides for his home near Trujillo, where he finds his family murdered. Maximus buries his wife and son; then collapses. He is found by slavers who take him to the Roman province of Zucchabar, where he is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo.\r\n",
      "Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators: Juba, a Numidian; and Hagen, a German. His military skills help him win matches and gain recognition from other gladiators and the crowd. Proximo reveals that he was once a gladiator, and advises Maximus that he must \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's Colosseum, because Commodus has organized 150 days of games.\r\n",
      "Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, Maximus leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus reveals himself and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and the Praetorian Guard is held back from striking them down.\r\n",
      "Maximus's next fight is a victory against a legendary undefeated gladiator. Commodus orders Maximus to kill the gladiator, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called \"Maximus the Merciful\" by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns and walks away.\r\n",
      "Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. Lucilla, Commodus's sister; Gracchus, an influential senator; and Maximus meet secretly. Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot by threatening Lucilla, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where Cicero is killed.\r\n",

Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated.

These missions leave the sensitive and intelligent Hallam conflicted and it is implied that he was either set up, or that the government became dissatisfied with the results of his more recent assignments, that results in his current predicament.\r\n",
      "In the wilderness of Silver Falls State Park, Oregon, Hallam encounters two deer hunters equipped with expensive scoped rifles. Hallam tells them that, because of these technological advantages, they are not \"true hunters.\" They pursue him through the woods but are no match for his skill and use of traps. He eventually kills the pair with his knife.\r\n",

He is approached to help apprehend Hallam, one of his former students. According to the authorities, Hallam has gone renegade after suffering severe battle stress from his time in the Kosovo War. The FBI provides recent photos showing how Hallam butchered the hunters.\r\n",

Bonham tracks Hallam and discovers his personal effects within a hollow tree trunk deep in the woods. When he emerges from the tree, Hallam is standing over him. Hallam immediately recognizes Bonham, who feigns ignorance, and asks why he never answered any of his letters. Bonham attacks, but in the ensuing hand-to-hand fight is beaten near unconscious. Suddenly, Hallam is shot from behind with a tranquilizer dart and the FBI task force, which had been tracking Bonham, sweeps in to capture Hallam.\r\n",

Alerted to the incident, Bonham and the FBI team track Hallam across the city and back into the wilderness, where Hallam consistently evades them. As he had been taught by Bonham, he crafts an improvised knife by making a fire and forging a blade from pieces of scrap metal. Convinced that the FBI's tactics aren't working and before more men are lost, Bonham strikes out on his own to find Aaron. Crafting his own knife out of stone, he goes into the wilderness and the search quickly becomes a fight to the death between teacher and student.\r\n",

Despite his hatred of Bagley for his role in the Indian Wars, an impoverished Algren takes the job for the money, and is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator knowledgeable about the Samurai.\r\n",
      "Algren finds the Imperial soldiers are actually conscripted peasants that have no knowledge of firearms or battle. Early in their training, Algren is informed that the Samurai are attacking one of Omura's railroads; Omura sends the army there, despite Algrenâ€™s protests that they are not ready. The battle is a disaster; the conscripts are routed and Gant is killed. Algren fights to the last before he is surrounded; expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when Samurai leader Katsumoto decides to spare him. Algren is taken to Katsumoto's village to live among his family. While he is poorly treated by the Samurai at first, he eventually gains their respect and actually becomes friends with Katsumoto. Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, and learns the Japanese language and culture. He develops sympathy for the Samurai, who are angry that the spread of modern technology has eroded traditional feudalism and the status and power of the Samurai. Algren develops an unspoken affection for Taka, Katsumoto's sister and the widow of a Samurai Algren killed.\r\n",
      "One night, as the village is watching a kabuki play, a group of ninja infiltrate the village and attempt to assassinate Katsumoto. Algren warns Katsumoto, saving his life, and then helps defend the village with the Samurai. Katsumoto requests a meeting with Emperor Meiji and is given safe passage to Tokyo. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren finds the Imperial Army is now a well-trained and fully equipped fighting force. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced Emperor has essentially become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto's arrest for carrying a sword in public and asks him to commit seppuku to redeem his honor. Algren refuses Omura's offer to lead the new army to crush the rebels; Omura orders him killed as well by sending assassins to kill Algren, but Algren kills the assailants. Algren assists the Samurai in freeing Katsumoto from the Imperial Army; in the process, Katsumoto's son Nobutada is mortally wounded, and he sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.\r\n",
      "As the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates seppuku, but Algren convinces him to fight until the end, and joins the Samurai in battle. Citing the Battle of Thermopylae, the Samurai use the Imperial Army's overconfidence to lure their soldiers into a trap and deprive them of artillery support. The ensuing mÃªlÃ©e battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the Imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that Imperial reinforcements are coming and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders a suicidal charge on horseback. During the charge, the Samurai break through Bagley's line; Algren kills Bagley, but they are quickly mowed down by gatling guns. The Imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying Samurai, orders all of the guns to cease fire, disregarding Omura's orders. A mortally wounded Katsumoto commits seppuku with Algren's help as the soldiers at the scene kneel down in respect for the fallen Samurai.\r\n",
      "Days later, as trade negotiations conclude, Algren, though injured, arrives and interrupts the proceedings. He presents the Emperor with Katsumoto's sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto died. The Emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize and continue to interact with other countries, it cannot forget its own culture and history. He rejects the trade offer with Omura protesting the decision; the Emperor chooses to seize the Omura family assets and distribute them to the poor. Algren's fate is shrouded in mystery; while various rumors about him circulate, Graham concludes that Algren had finally found peace in his life and returned to the village to reunite with Taka. \n",

As Craven prepares dinner at home, Emma suffers a nosebleed and vomits again. As the two exit the house on their way to the hospital, a masked gunman below yells \"Craven!\", fatally wounds Emma with a shotgun, and escapes as Craven attends to his daughter.\r\n",
      "After identifying the body at the medical examiner's office, he takes a lock of Emma's hair as a memento and incidentally discovers that it is radioactive. Then, though everyone assumes Craven was the gunman's target, when he finds Emma had a .45 pistol in her night stand, he starts to suspect that possibly Emma was the intended target. At the police station, he checks the gun's ownership and finds that it belongs to her boyfriend David (Shawn Roberts). David is living in fear of a company called Northmoor, where he and Emma worked. She discovered that Northmoor, a research and development facility under contract to the U.S. government by Jack Bennett (Danny Huston), was secretly manufacturing nuclear weapons using foreign material and foreign specifications. The weapons were intended to be traced to foreign nations if they were used as dirty bombs.\r\n",
      "Burning her clothing in his backyard, he encounters Jedburgh (Ray Winstone), a British \"consultant\" tasked with preventing the disclosure of Emma's information, dealing with Craven however he sees fit. Jedburgh takes a liking to Craven, leaving him to investigate. Craven repeatedly has visions of Emma, even having short conversations and interactions with her, typically as the happy young child he remembers and loves. Craven eventually discovers through one of Emma's friends, an activist who is nearly killed by another of Northmoor's agents. They eventually kill a hitman marked as a fall guy after he is set up for killing Emma.\r\n",
      "Craven confronts lawyer and Massachusetts U.S. Senator Jim Pine (Damian Young) who was contacted earlier by Emma, revealing that Craven knows almost everything that happened. After examining his fridge with a Geiger counter, Craven discovers that his milk has been contaminated, most likely with the poison used on his daughter. His fellow detective and friend, Bill (Jay O. Sanders), comes to Craven's home while the Northmoor agents break into the house. Craven realizes that Bill set him up before the agents taser and kidnap Craven, taking him away in an unmarked ambulance. He wakes up handcuffed to a gurney in the Northmoor facility, but manages to escape.\r\n",
      "His health deteriorating rapidly from the poison, Craven heads to Bennett's house and executes the Northmoor agents after forcing one of them at gunpoint to scream the name \"Craven,\" finally identifying him as Emma's killer. Bennett shoots and wounds Craven, but Craven also wounds Bennett, and manages to force some of the radioactive milk, which he has brought with him, down Bennett's throat. Bennett attempts to take some pills to counteract the radioactivity, but Craven shoots him dead.\r\n",
      "Jedburgh, who is suffering from an unrelated terminal illness, meets with the Senator and two political advisers who had hired Jedburgh to handle Craven. They want to spin the Northmoor incident in a positive light. Jedburgh suggests that an assassination attempt on the Senator could be an angle to drive Bennett's death out of the headlines. They are pleased with this idea until Jedburgh abruptly kills both advisers and the senator. When a young Massachusetts State Police officer nervously enters the Senator's room upon hearing the gunshots, Jedburgh asks the officer at gunpoint if he has children. When the officer replies yes, Jedburgh lowers his gun, allowing the officer to shoot him dead.\r\n",
      "While Craven lies dying in the hospital from his wounds and radiation poisoning, a young reporter for the local FOX TV station WFXT, who had spoken to Craven a few nights earlier at his home, opens a letter from him which contains DVDs (recorded by Emma) revealing the conspiracy, with Craven's \"good luck\" wishes, ensuring Northmoor's end. As Craven dies, the spirit of Emma comforts him. Craven and Emma are then shown leaving the hospital together, walking down the corridor and toward a bright, white light. \n",

      "===========================\n",
      "Upon leaving prison, \"Driver\" breaks into a run until he retrieves his 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle. He drives to an office in Bakersfield, California and kills a man. Driver visits the man who gave him the car and gun and forces him to give him a list of names. Meanwhile, Driver is tracked by detective Cicero and \"Cop\", a detective on the verge of retirement whose life is off track due to a debilitating heroin addiction. Cicero gets a break in the case when she recognizes Driver on video. Later, a nameless hitman, \"Killer\", is hired to kill Driver. Killer promises his girlfriend Lily it is his last job.\r\n",
      "Driver heads to the second name on his list, an old man who films his own personal snuff films. He is in the middle of filming a sexual assault when Driver busts in the door and shoots him dead. Killer initiates a gun fight in the hallway, but Driver escapes. This affects Killer philosophically, who proposes to his girlfriend and takes the case personally. Cop and Detective are investigating Driver's past and discover he was double crossed. Cicero remembers Driver from a video of his half-brother Gary's death, filmed by the videographer. On tape, an unidentified man shoots Driver in the head, but he narrowly survives, needing a metal plate in his skull.\r\n",
      "Driver visits his old girlfriend's house. She knows he is killing the people in the video and, after revealing she aborted their unborn child and has begun a new life, she tells him she hopes he succeeds. At a strip club in Nevada, Driver stabs a bouncer who killed his half-brother, Gary. Soon, both Cop and Killer get word that the man survived the stabbing and is in the hospital. Knowing Driver will go back to finish him off, they converge there.\r\n",
      "Driver enters the hospital and kills the man when he is in surgery. Cop attempts to bring down Driver but is unsuccessful; however, Driver spares his life after seeing his badge. While driving away from the hospital, Driver encounters Killer. After a high-speed chase on the freeway, Killer shoots Driver in the neck after Driver shoots out his tires.[3]\r\n",
      "The penultimate name is Driver's father. Driver believes his father arranged to have him and his half-brother Gary killed after they refused to share the money they stole in a bank job. Driver is the result of his mother's affair, which Driver's father never forgave. Driver finds out his father died years before, and his mother stitches the gunshot wound on his neck before he leaves. The last man is a traveling evangelist, and after his service is over and everyone has left, Driver confronts him. The evangelist knows why he is there and tells him that he has turned his life around, begging for forgiveness. Driver spares him, only to be confronted by Killer.\r\n",
      "Detective Cicero learns the true identity of the man who shot Driver. She hurries to the church; Cop is already on the scene. Killer tells Driver to pick up his gun so they can have a test of skill. Driver declines, saying he has no fight with him. Killer explains he wanted to be better since he could not walk when he was a child. Cop walks in and shoots Driver in the head, revealing it was he who shot Driver in the video. He gives Killer the money for the job, a single dollar, but Killer declines. Killer departs, telling Cop never to contact him again.\r\n",
      "Cop calls his girlfriend, telling her they will be okay because he closed the case and how he has been reading up on women. Cop's wife Marina was Gary's girlfriend and an informant for Cop. She told him about the bank job, and Cop put together the crew to take out Gary and Driver. Suddenly, he is shot by Driver, who survived the shot due to his metal plate. Detective Cicero arrives on the scene after Driver has already left, and she covers up Cop's involvement. Driver scatters his brother's ashes in the sea and drives off into the sunset; simultaneously, the Evangelist begins a sermon on forgiveness. \n",

      "Harold Meadows (Lloyd) is a tailor's apprentice for his uncle in Little Bend, California. He is so shy around women that he can barely speak to them (to stop his stuttering, his uncle has to blow a whistle). Despite this, Harold writes a \"how to\" book for young men entitled The Secret of Making Love, detailing how to woo different types of young women, such as \"the vampire\" and \"the flapper\" (in scenes that parodied two other popular films of the time, Trifling Women and Flaming Youth[citation needed]), and takes a train to see a publisher in Los Angeles.\r\n",
      "The same day, rich young Mary Buckingham (Ralston) boards the same train after her automobile breaks down in Little Bend. No dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her Pomeranian under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away. Harold rescues her dog and helps Mary hide it from the conductor. She sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm. They become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its final destination and everyone else has departed. Upon returning home, Mary rejects the latest in a string of marriage proposals from persistent suitor Ronald DeVore, a self-centered rich man who is almost twice Mary's age and who harbors no true feelings for her, but merely wants her as a trophy wife.\r\n",
      "After her car is repaired, Mary intentionally detours through Little Bend repeatedly, hoping to see Harold again. On one such trip, Ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions cause Mary to swerve and get her car stuck near the outskirts of Little Bend. While Ronald walks back to town for a tow, Mary goes for a walk and happens to reunite with Harold. After telling Mary about the remainder of his book, Harold informs her that he is going to see the publisher, Roger Thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter that will be about her. They agree to meet again afterward. Meanwhile, Ronald runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to introduce her to his family, but he stalls, then rides away in the tow-vehicle.\r\n",
      "Mr. Thornby's professional readers find Harold's book hilariously absurd, so he rejects it. Without any royalty money, Harold figures he cannot ask Mary to marry him. So he pretends that he was only using her as part of his research. Heartbroken, Mary impulsively agrees to marry Ronald. Afterward, though, one of Mr. Thornby's senior employees convinces him that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so Thornby decides to publish it as \"The Boob's Diary\".\r\n",
      "A few days later, a depressed Harold gets a letter from the publisher, but just rips it up without opening it, assuming that it is a rejection notice. Fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the accompanying letter states that the book will be published as a comedy. At first, Harold is outraged, but then he realizes that he can propose to Mary after all. However, when he sees a newspaper headline announcing Mary and Ronald's wedding that same day at her family's estate, he gives up. By chance, the same woman whom Ronald had met a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the newspaper story, tearfully exclaims that she is Ronald's wife. As proof, she shows Harold a locket with the couple's wedding portrait and the engraved words \"to my wife\" that Ronald had given her two years earlier.\r\n",
      "Harold embarks on a frenzied headlong dash, involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle (from missing the train to various cars to a trolley to a police motorcycle to a horse-drawn wagon to horseback), through the countryside and along the crowded streets of Culver City and Los Angeles. He bursts in just in time, but he cannot stop stuttering long enough to expose Ronald's intended bigamy. So Harold simply carries Mary off. When they are alone, he tells her about Ronald's secret and shows her the locket. Mary gets Harold to propose (with an assist from a passing mail carrier's whistle), and she accepts. \n",

In the end, she manages to contact Ronald by telephone, who in a sudden show of athleticism sprints to her dormitory, pole vaults into her window, and fights off Jeff by throwing household objects at him.

There she encounters a charming handsome man who pretends to be interested in purchasing some children's toys but, after many humorous demonstrations by Maggie, the manager comes over and gives the man his time card. The man is said to be Joe Grant (Buddy Rogers) though in reality he is the son of the owner; making him Joseph Merrill. To prove to his father he is ready for his engagement, he has taken the job of stockboy under an assumed name.\r\n",
      "Annoyed, Maggie takes Joe back to the stockroom and tells him to get to work. He is so inept that she calls him, 'The Dumbest Stockboy in the World' though she promises to take him under her wing, much to his amusement.\r\n",
      "A few days later, after her shift, Maggie is outside waiting for Joe. She appears to have a crush on him. Some of her coworkers tease her but eventually warn her that Joe is coming, causing Maggie to hop on her ride home from work: the back of an open truck. Joe is swarmed with salesgirls who try for his attention causing him to not focus on Maggie. Determined Maggie throws her bag on the ground as the vehicle pulls away. Joe picks it up and chases the truck down to give it to her. After three more times of this, he finally grows weary and jumps in the truck to join Maggie, who feigns innocence.\r\n",
      "The two flirt and Maggie shows him pictures of her off-kilter family. Once they reach her home, she invites him in for supper only to find her family is causing a commotion. Her father (Lucien Littlefield) is an elderly postal worker who is meek and easily subdued. Her mother (Sunshine Hart) is a dramatic woman who enjoys going to random funerals and makes frequent use of smelling salts to avoid fainting. Her sister Liz (Carmelita Geraghty) is a flapper who has a boyfriend who gets her into trouble. Maggie does her best to hide the goings on but eventually caves and sends Joe on his way hoping to have dinner with him another day.\r\n",
      "Time passes and Joe's mother is planning his engagement announcement party. However she has not mentioned it to him, hoping to make it a surprise. Joe has been promoted and is now Maggie's boss. However, he still eats lunch with her every day in the stockroom. During one such lunch, after receiving the note to join his parents for dinner (for the surprise party), Maggie gives him a watch for his birthday. He is touched and puts it on. Shortly after this he accidentally catches his sleeve on a nail. Trying to pull himself free, he accidentally puts his arm around Maggie, and after the mutual surprise the two kiss.\r\n",
      "Enamored with each other they head out on the town to walk in the rain. Joe begins to spend money and she tells him he'll end up in the poorhouse. Joe offers to buy her dinner at a nice restaurant but, embarrassed by her shoddy work clothes, Maggie declines. Joe gets the idea to tell her they should follow the store's company motto, \"We're all a family\" and that, if they were family, they could eat at the Merrill Mansion. Maggie, thinking he is joking, agrees. Meanwhile, her sister is arrested because of her association with her boyfriend, and is taken to night court. Her family frets at not being able to find Maggie, who they believe needs to help Liz out of the mess. Maggie had tried to call them, but after a few rings (while her father made his way to the phone) she hung up.\r\n",
      "Arriving at the Merrill Mansion, Maggie is amazed that it is the real deal. Joe is amused with her reluctance but eventually gets her into the mansion, much to the butler's amusement. Maggie is extremely reluctant until Joe convinces the butler to say 'a Merrill employee eats here almost every night!' Maggie relaxes and tells Joe they should pretend to be Mr. and Mrs. Merrill. Joe is extremely amused by this, and at her lack of formal dinner habits.\r\n",
      "At the surprise engagement party, Joe's family sits concerned. They return home to find Joe and Maggie, who has hidden under the table. Joe admits he is 'Joseph Merrill' but before he can explain further his fiancee (Avonne Taylor) arrives and kisses him in front of Maggie. Maggie, heartbroken leaves. Joe, upset, tells his fiancee he had broken Maggie's heart and must go after her.\r\n",
      "Maggie walks and walks until she returns to where Joe and her shared a moment which happens to be by the night court. She sees her family arrive and after they chasten her they enter the court to try to save Liz from prison. Meanwhile Joe arrives at the same spot only to be helped by a homeless man who had watched their interactions. Joe enters the court to hear Maggie's passionate plea for her sister, whom the judge eventually lets go.\r\n",
      "While Maggie fetches water for her 'on the verge of fainting' mother, Joe walks over to Maggie and apologizes, saying he did not love his fiancee and would not marry her. He then proposes to Maggie which causes (for a change) her sister to faint. While everyone tries to revive Liz, Liz's boyfriend makes a remark to her father about Maggie 'taking up with the Merrill boy' implying that it was only for sex. Joe, offended, punches him and begins to fight in the courtroom.\r\n",
      "The next day, Maggie is back home, reading the paper which has headlines about their romance. Joe's father (Hobart Bosworth) arrives at the home. He tells Maggie he wants to send his son to Hawaii until the scandal blew over, which Joe agreed to. However, Joe apparently made plans to bring Maggie as well and marry on the boat. Mr. Merrill, not happy with this, tries to buy Maggie off with a check for $10,000 just as Joe arrives, unaware his father is there. Joe tells Maggie his plans and she becomes upset. Angry, she begins a whole tirade against him trying to find out if he really loved her or not. She begins to claim she is just a jazz girl and knew who he was all along. That she was a gold digger and just after his money and, thanks to his father, she now had what she wanted. She even plays a jazz record and puts on lipstick in an attempt to prove her point.\r\n",
      "Joe begins to cry, and Maggie, touched, breaks down and admits that none of it is true and the real reason she cannot go away with him is because of her family (who had been listening in the living room the whole time) who needs her more than he does. Her father becomes livid and declares it was time 'he became the father of the family' and takes charge of his wife and daughters. In a comedic scene he commands everyone (including both Merrills) to pack Maggie's things for the ship which leaves in ten minutes.\r\n",
      "After an extreme car ride, the couple barely make it to the departing boat. Once boarded, the father realizes he never gave Maggie her suitcase. He tries to throw the suitcase onto the boat, but it ends up in the ocean. The couple waves goodbye and eventually get crowded back from view. When the crowd leaves, we see the couple kissing. \n",

Harold (Harold Goodwin), an MGM cameraman who has designs on Sally himself, mocks his ambition.\r\n",
      "Sally, however, encourages Buster and suggests he film anything and everything. Buster's first attempts show his total lack of experience. He double exposes or over exposes much of the footage, and the rest is simply no good. Despite this setback, Sally agrees to go out with Buster, after her Sunday date cancels. They go to the city plunge (pool), where Buster gets involved in numerous mishaps. Later, Harold offers Sally a ride home; Buster has to sit in the rumble seat, where he gets drenched in the rain.\r\n",
      "The next day, Sally gives him a hot tip she has just received that something big is going to happen in Chinatown. In his rush to get there, he accidentally runs into an organ grinder, who falls and apparently kills his monkey. A nearby cop makes Buster pay for the monkey and take its body with him. The monkey turns out only to be dazed and joins Buster on his venture.\r\n",

At the end, he is rescued from Tong members by the timely arrival of the police, led by a cop (Harry Gribbon) who had been the unintentional victim of several of Buster's antics over the last few days. The cop tries to have him committed to the mental hospital, but Buster makes his escape with his camera intact.\r\n",

      "Buster returns to his old job, but does not give up on filming, setting up to record a boat race. He then discovers that he has Tong footage after all; the mischievous monkey had switched the reels. Sally and Harold are speeding along in one of the boats. When Harold makes too sharp a turn, the two are thrown into the river. Harold saves himself, but Sally is trapped by the circling boat. Buster stops filming to jump in and rescues her. The monkey gets behind the camera to film the daring rescue. When Buster rushes to a drug store to get medical supplies to revive her, Harold returns and takes credit for the rescue. The two go off, leaving the broken-hearted Buster behind.\r\n",

The boss decides to screen it for Harold and Sally for laughs, but is thrilled by what he sees, calling it the best camerawork he has seen in years. They also see footage of Buster's boat footage and the monkey's shot of Buster's rescue of Sally. The boss sends Sally to get Buster. She tells him he is in for a great reception. Buster assumes a ticker-tape parade is in his honor, whereas it is really for Charles Lindbergh. \n",
